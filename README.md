# CodingTest

I am sandeep bs(9980406636), demostrating order processing challenge.
To accomplish the task "Problem Statement 2: Business Rules Engine", I reckon below points.
1. I have used .net application to demostarate the above solution
2. I have used factory pattern so that the code can be extented with every new requirements without affecting the existing code/class.
3. I have adopted SOLID principle in the entire application
4. ENUMS are used so that the code is user readable.
5. Normally, BIN folder, SOLUTION files and OBJ are not checked in to the source. But for the sake of the demo, so that it is easier for the evaluator, I have checked in the Solution files.
6. IN case the Unit test project is not working, PLease add the reference of the Orderprocessing project to the unit test project.
